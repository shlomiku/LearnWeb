<h2>AngularJS Sample Application: Controllers</h2>

<div ng-app = "mainApp" ng-controller = "studentController">
    <p>this time we give a name to our ng-app. this is because we define a controller in the script part.</p>
    <p>we declare the controller in the div, which means it is usable in the scope of our div as done below.</p>
    Enter first name: <input type = "text" ng-model = "student.firstName"><br><br>
    Enter last name: <input type = "text" ng-model = "student.lastName"><br>
    <br>

    You are entering: {{student.fullName()}}
    <br/>
    <p>in our controller we received the $scope which is the scope of div. <br/>
        that means that we can change the variable of the scope. we added a var named student. <br/>
        now we can access it in the scope of the div, so when we bind (using ng-model) an input to our "student" <br/>
        it works like magic.
    </p>
</div>

<script src = "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.14/angular.min.js"></script>

    var mainApp = angular.module("mainApp", []);

    mainApp.controller('studentController', function($scope) {
        $scope.student = {
            firstName: "Mahesh",
            lastName: "Parashar",

            fullName: function() {
                var studentObject;
                studentObject = $scope.student;
                return studentObject.firstName + " " + studentObject.lastName;
            }
        };
    });
